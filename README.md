In the theme directory the following changes have been made...

Which enables these trivial features changes...

 * The sidebar is now always open by default.
 * The default size of the sidebar is changed from 300px to 200px

I noticed that when you actually toggle the sidebar to closed
and shutdown your browser and bring it back up that it is still
closed so that is kind of cool.
